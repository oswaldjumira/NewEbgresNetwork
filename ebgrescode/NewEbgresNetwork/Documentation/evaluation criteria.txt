These are some of the statistics we need to collect from the simulations:

1. Lifetime: the time slot in which the first node becomes isolated (dead). (there are many methods to calculate lifetime)
2. Total energy dissipated in the system: the total energy consumed by all nodes during the execution of the algorithm. (we need the energy used and energy remaining)
3. Average energy consumed per packet, namely the total energy dissipated in the system divided by the total network throughput (capacity);
4. The total network throughput (capacity);
5. The threshold-related throughput - The total number of delivered packets until the first time when the loss ratio exceeds some given threshold
6. Frequency of receiving data packets at the end nodes- In evaluating performance, we need to use a program that  records how often data is being received through the gateway  nodes.
7. Average delay per packet (latency) - The average time a packet takes from a node in the sensing  state to the gateway (destination). The average delay from the time instant when a packet is generated at the source node to the time instant when it is delivered to the destination.
8. Maximum network capacity - The total number of packets successfully routed until no more packets can be routed.
9. Total packet throughput - The total number of packets successfully received at the destination nodes. (packetloss calculation)
10. Average and  standard  deviation of nodes’ lifetime
11. Expiration time and expiration sequence - The time when a node exhausts its battery capacity. The sequence of nodes sorted in ascending order of the
expiration times. The expiration sequence provides a useful indicator of how each algorithm affects the lifetime of the individual nodes, and the entire network.
12. Coverage degree - number of nodes divided by the area of coverage.
